### Hi There! :slightly_smiling_face:

<p>I am a Data Science specialist currently pursuing a Master's degree in Statistics. I have worked in the aerospace, retail, and technology industries, where I was responsible for building and maintaining relationships with customers and partners while focusing on relational values. My analytical, yet warm and enthusiastic, profile allowed me to get exposed to many sorts of domain knowledge. For example, business intelligence, digital marketing, supply chain, finances, customer service, project management, among others, where I was able to help senior managers in the decision-making process by providing insightful prescriptive analytics reports. It's been a fun ride!</p>

<p>I see (eat, breathe, and dream) data in everything I do! I love data science for the journey more than the results of it. The process of making something out of seemingly nothing delights me every time.</p>

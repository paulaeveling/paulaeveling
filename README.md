### Hi There! :slightly_smiling_face:

<p>I am a Data Science specialist currently pursuing a Master's degree in Statistics. In my career, I have worked in the aerospace, retail, and technology industries, where I was responsible for building and maintaining relationships with customers and partners while focusing on relational values. My analytical, yet warm and enthusiast, profile allowed me to get exposed to many sorts of domain knowledge, such as digital marketing, operations, logistics, finances, customer service, project management, among others, where I was able to help senior managers by providing insightful information for the decision-making process. It's been a fun ride!</p>

<p>I see (eat, sleep and dream) data in everything I do! I love data science for the journey more than the results of it. The process of making something out of seemingly nothing delights me every time.</p>
